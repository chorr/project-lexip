This library was compiled on WinXP Pro SP2 with JDK 1.4.2_13.
The enclosed make.bat file will probably work for no one but me.
However, careful reading of the batch file should at least
illustrate the steps used so that you may find equivalent
build steps for your environment.  javadoc will probably
complain about the processing.core classes (unless your build
environment is very well set up), you can safely ignore those.
